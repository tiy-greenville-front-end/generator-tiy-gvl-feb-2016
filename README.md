### Yeoman TIY Generator

This is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator made specifically for students at The Iron Yard and is used as an introduction to Yeoman & npm. It includes a specific set of tools that we use throughout our course and purposefully omits certain ones until we need them.

### What is Optional

```sh
npm install -g generator-tiy-gvl-feb-2016
